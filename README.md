## Predict Customer Success
Around 10% of Swire Coca-Cola’s business is “B2B,” driven by local businesses such as restaurants. When a new restaurant is
launching, the most important decision Swire needs to make is the profitability of the business. Depending on the profitability of the
business Swire can determine price and funding to offer to the business. A lower price point on Coca-Cola will make it more likely
that Swire ‘wins’ the business but will create a risk that the account isn’t profitable. Offering great prices to a business that will thrive
creates a loyal and valuable customer, offering the same discounts to a customer who doesn’t last is a significant loss of investment.
For this reason, Swire Coca-Cola needs to constantly improve their ability to predict the success/profitability/sales of a new
restaurants in their market.

Problem: predict the popularity (4.0 or higher in online reviews), longevity (1, 2, or 3+ years), and total 3-year sales volume of new
Swire customers based on historical results.
